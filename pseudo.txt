// Pseudocode for the function substr(string, keyword)

Function substr(string, keyword):

1. Check if the input strings are valid
   - If string is NULL or keyword is NULL:
       - Return NULL

2. Iterate through each character in the main string
   - While string is not at end (string != '\0'):
       - If the current character of string matches the first character of keyword:
           - Set pointer1 to the current position in string
           - Set pointer2 to the start of keyword

       - Check if the following characters match
           - While True:
               - If pointer1 is at the end of the string:
                   - Return NULL

               - If pointer2 is at the end of keyword:
                   - Return the current position in string

               - If characters at pointer1 and pointer2 donâ€™t match:
                   - Move to the next character in string
                   - Exit the inner loop

               - Move pointer1 to the next character in string
               - Move pointer2 to the next character in keyword

       - Move to the next character in string
